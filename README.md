# SD201
## Description
This project (november 2023) determines the grade for SD201 Data Mining course at Télécom Paris.  
It consists of several steps to write an algorithm building and infering binary decision trees.  
The metric used to choose the split feature is the Gini index.

## Usage
In the `lab01` folder :
* `python main.py [debug or eval] [question number]` to run the program
* `python check_results.py [debug or eval] [question number]` to check the results of the previous command

`debug` enables to see the result for each test file and `eval` checks the hash of the output file.
